This repository complements an acadamic report title "Galerkin least-squares finite element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with FEniCS" that I submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford. I used the FEniCS software to simulate the process of turning natural water into drinking water, solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a Galerkin Least Squares stabilization method. Install FEniCS and run `navierstokes.py` to replicate this simulation. The `.mov` files show the resulting laminar and turbulent flows.
